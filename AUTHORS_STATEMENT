This package is presented with the hope that it will help others do science.

Most of the authors are not professional software developers. 
In the spirit of collaboration and to avoid discouraging others---especially women and members of other groups underrepresented in software development---from sharing their code publicly, it is expected that all criticism, corrections, and suggestions for improvement will be made respectfully and in good faith.
